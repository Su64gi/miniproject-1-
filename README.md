Title: Air Pollution and Environmental Monitoring System

Description:
The Air Pollution and Environmental Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to monitor and visualize air quality data in real-time. It aims to provide users with accurate information about the quality of the air in their vicinity, helping them make informed decisions to protect their health and the environment.

Key Features:

Real-time Data Monitoring:
The system collects air quality data from various sensors deployed across different locations. It continuously updates the data in real-time, providing users with the most recent information about air quality parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, CO2, NO2, SO2, O3, etc.

Interactive Dashboard:
A user-friendly dashboard displays the collected data in an interactive manner. Users can view detailed information about specific pollutants, track historical trends, and compare air quality across different locations using intuitive charts and graphs.

Geospatial Visualization:
The system utilizes geospatial visualization techniques to present air quality data on a map interface. Users can explore pollution levels in different areas by navigating the map, allowing them to identify pollution hotspots and areas with relatively cleaner air.

API Integration: The system offers API integration capabilities, allowing developers to integrate air quality data into third-party applications or services. This enables cross-platform compatibility and seamless data sharing with other environmental monitoring systems.

Technologies Used:
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
API Integration: RESTful API design principles.

The Air Pollution and Environmental Monitoring System is a comprehensive solution for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing air quality data. By leveraging advanced technologies and user-friendly interfaces, it empowers individuals, communities, and policymakers to take proactive measures towards mitigating air pollution and safeguarding public health and the environment.
